# ☁️ Weather App

This weather application is an **interactive** and **engaging** application used to check the weather in different locations.

## 🧠 About the project

I developed this as a quick solo project to capture my understanding for .js, css, html and python trying to mix them all together.

---

## ✨ Features

  - **Interactive Interface**
  - **Realtime API Calling**
  - **Animations for every scenario**

## 🚀 Getting started

### Prerequisites

  - Python 3.9+
  - A free API key from [openweathermap.org](https://home.openweathermap.org/)

### Clone and running
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neb1n/Weather-App.git
cd Weather-App
Replace your API Key with the blank in the website
```

It is **imperative** that you replace the API key else the application will not work.

### Run the app
```bash
python app.py
```

Then in your browser of choice go to:
```bash
127.0.0.1:5000
or
localhost:5000
```
